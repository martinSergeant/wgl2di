# wgl2di

## Intoduction
Very basic 2D renderer using webgl (via regl). The aim is to create trees and basic genome viewers based on Webgl as canvas and SVG just can't cope with the large amount of data being displayed. Hence more functionality and optimiization will occur as the need arises.

## Qick Start
Just open the index.html in a browser. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out and drag outside of a shape to scroll. Individual shapes can be dragged by clicking on them
